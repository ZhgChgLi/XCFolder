XCFolder is a powerful utility that converts Xcode virtual folders (group) into real filesystem directories (folder), facilitating seamless migration to modern build systems like Tuist or XcodeGen.

This tool ensures perfect synchronization between your Xcode project structure and the actual filesystem organization, making project maintenance more intuitive and efficient.

## Key Features
- **Smart Group Conversion**: Intelligently transforms Xcode virtual groups into physical directories while preserving project structure
- **Perfect Synchronization**: Maintains 1:1 mapping between Xcode project navigator and filesystem directories
- **Automated Organization**: Eliminates manual folder management with automated synchronization
- **Migration Ready**: Prepares your project structure for modern build systems like Tuist and XcodeGen

## Usage
### Step 1. Clone this repo
```
git clone https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/XCFolder.git
```

#### Modify Configuration.yml if needed
`./Configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
# Paths to ignore when scanning for source files
ignorePaths:
- "Pods"
- "Frameworks"
- "Products"

# Allowed file types to include when scanning
allowFileTypes:
- "sourcecode.swift"      # Swift source code files
- "sourcecode.c.objc"     # Objective-C source code files
- "sourcecode.cpp.objcpp" # Objective-C++ source code files  
- "sourcecode.c.h"        # C/Objective-C header files
- "file.xib"             # Interface Builder XIB files
- "file.storyboard"      # Interface Builder Storyboard files
- "folder.assetcatalog"  # Asset catalog containing images and resources
- "text.json.xcstrings"  # Localized strings in JSON format
- "text.plist.strings"   # Localized strings in plist format

# Whether to move files only, without changing .xcodeproj settings
moveFileOnly: false

```

### Step 2. Run with Swift
```
cd ./XCFolder
swift run XCFolder YOUR_XCODEPROJ_FILE.xcodeproj ./Configuration.yaml
```
#### For example
```
swift run XCFolder ./TestProject/DCDeviceTest.xcodeproj ./Configuration.yaml
```

### Step 3. Wait for the execution to complete.
