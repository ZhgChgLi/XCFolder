XCFolder is a powerful tool that converts Xcode virtual groups into actual directories (associated folder), enabling seamless integration with modern xcode project gen tools like Tuist and XcodeGen.

By ensuring perfect synchronization between your Xcode project structure and the filesystem, XCFolder simplifies project organization, enhances maintainability, and improves workflow efficiency.

## Key Features
- **Smart Group Conversion**: Intelligently transforms Xcode virtual groups into physical directories while preserving project structure
- **Perfect Synchronization**: Maintains 1:1 mapping between Xcode project navigator and filesystem directories
- **Automated Organization**: Eliminates manual folder management with automated synchronization
- **Migration Ready**: Prepares your project structure for modern build systems like Tuist and XcodeGen

## Usage
### Step 1. Clone this repo
```
git clone https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/XCFolder.git
```

#### Modify Configuration.yml if needed
`./Configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
# Paths to ignore when scanning for source files
ignorePaths:
- "Pods"
- "Frameworks"
- "Products"

# File types to ignore when scanning for source files
ignoreFileTypes:
- "wrapper.framework" # Frameworks
- "wrapper.pb-project" # Xcode project files

# Whether to move files only, without changing .xcodeproj settings
moveFileOnly: false
```

### Step 2. Run with Swift
```
cd ./XCFolder
swift run XCFolder YOUR_XCODEPROJ_FILE.xcodeproj ./Configuration.yaml
```
#### For example
```
swift run XCFolder ./TestProject/DCDeviceTest.xcodeproj ./Configuration.yaml
```

### Step 3. Wait for the execution to complete.
